🌾 Offline Field Data App
I built this fully offline Progressive Web App (PWA) to solve a daily frustration in my breeding programs: collecting reliable field data without an internet connection.

I was tired of dealing with soggy paper field books, messy data transcription, and heavy software that freezes when it loses signal. I needed a lightweight, flexible tool that works flawlessly in remote locations, allows for quick sub-sampling of traits, and feeds my raw data directly into my R and Python analytics pipelines.

✨ Why I Built This (Core Features)
📡 100% Offline-First: Powered by Service Workers and IndexedDB. I can stand in the middle of a trial field with zero bars of service, and the app won't miss a beat.
📂 Dynamic Workspaces: I can snap between different projects (like a Wheat MLT or a Mustard F4 trial) instantly. Each workspace gets its own isolated database.
🗺️ Flexible Trial Mapping: I didn't want to force a specific Excel template. You just upload your existing CSV trial map, and the app dynamically aligns your Plot, Genotype, and Replication columns.
🌱 Sub-Sample Engine: We rarely measure just one plant per plot. I built a dynamic sub-sampling tool so I can easily record 3, 5, or 10 observations for a single trait, keeping the raw data preserved for intra-plot variance and heritability calculations.
🚨 Real-Time QC: A built-in Z-Score scanner catches "fat-finger" typos while I'm still standing in front of the plot, saving me hours of data-cleaning later.
📸 Offline Media Capture: I can snap photos of morphological anomalies or disease symptoms right in the app. They safely sit in the tablet's browser memory until I get back to Wi-Fi.
☁️ Cloud Sync: One tap pushes all my data and decoded images directly to my Google Drive and Google Sheets.
🧬 The "Data Splitter" Analytics Pipeline
When dealing with field data, there is always a conflict between wanting a clean spreadsheet for quick viewing and needing the raw, nested sub-samples for serious statistical modeling.

To solve this, I wrote a custom Google Apps Script backend that acts as an intelligent data splitter. When I hit sync:

Mean Calculation: It calculates the true mean of my plot sub-samples and drops it into the primary trait column for easy reading.
Variance Preservation: It dynamically generates hidden "Raw" columns at the far right of the sheet, preserving every individual plant measurement.
Image Routing: It decodes the Base64 image strings, saves the actual JPEGs to a Google Drive folder, and drops a clickable link directly into the plot's row.
The result is a Google Sheet that is instantly ready to be pulled directly into tidyverse or pandas for GCA matrices or ANOVA.

🏗️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+). No heavy frameworks.
Local Storage: IndexedDB to handle massive trial datasets and Base64 images natively.
Backend: Serverless Google Apps Script (GAS) acting as a REST API.
Storage: Google Sheets (Relational Data) & Google Drive (Images).
🚀 How to Set It Up
If you want to use this for your own trials, here is how to deploy it:

1. Frontend Deployment (GitHub Pages)
Fork or clone this repository so index.html, app.js, sw.js, and manifest.json are in your root directory.
Go to Settings > Pages in your repo.
Set the Source to Deploy from a branch and select main.
Open the live URL on your tablet or phone and select "Add to Home Screen" to install it as an offline app.
2. Backend Setup (Google Apps Script)
To make the ☁️ Sync to Cloud button work, you need to set up the router:

Create a folder in your Google Drive (e.g., Field App Photos) and copy the Folder ID from the URL.
Create a blank Google Sheet.
Click Extensions > Apps Script.
Paste the backend code (provided in the deployment steps of this project).
Replace PASTE_YOUR_FOLDER_ID_HERE with your actual Drive Folder ID.
Click Deploy > New deployment.
Type: Web app
Execute as: Me
Who has access: Anyone
Copy the resulting Web App URL.
Back in this code repository, open app.js, locate the syncToCloud() function, and paste your URL into the GAS_URL variable.
Commit the change, bump your CACHE_NAME version in sw.js, and refresh the app on your device!
